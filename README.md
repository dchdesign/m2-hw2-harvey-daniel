# m2-hw2-harvey-daniel

Had issues with push to github. Ended up uploading directly. 

This is what my console was saying: 

danharvey (master) m2-hw2-harvey-daniel-master
$ git push --set-upstream https://github.com/dchdesign/m2-hw2-harvey-daniel.git master
To https://github.com/dchdesign/m2-hw2-harvey-daniel.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/dchdesign/m2-hw2-harvey-daniel.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
